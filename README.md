# Clicked-on-Ad---Logistic-Regression
The advertising data set that we will be working with for this project will indicate whether or not a specific internet user clicked on an advertisement that was displayed on a business's website. We are going to make an effort to develop a model that, based on the characteristics of the user, will determine whether or not they will click on an advertisement.
